    "firstline": "In the year 2000 LungA Art festival was held for the first time.",
    "para1":"It’s an intimate art festival where creativity, arts and culture are celebrated with workshops, lectures and events. The festival goes off with a bang in a culmination of exhibitions and concerts that take place over the final weekend.",
    "para2": "LungA has earned quite the reputation, both locally and internationally, for its great ambiance, good-quality workshops and the fantastic enthusiasm of the participants year on year. Furthermore, the festival has fostered joy, self-knowledge, new lovers, new friends and warm memories to those who come to participate in it.",
    "para3": "The LungA “family” now consists of both the yearly art festival and the LungA school. These are separately run projects but they share the same name, values and ideology.",
    "themeintro":"This year's theme would have been:",
    "theme":"Behaviour",
    "themeheadline":" Why we do what we do – cause and effect",
    "themepara1":"In this years’ theme, we aim to explore what drives our own behavior, and to challenge ourselves to see how conscious we really are of what we do and why we do it. What role do our personalities play, in contrast to the social cues and conditioning we receive from our culture? What could these different forms of conditioning look like, and what would a different starting point lead to?",
    "themepara2":"We need to learn to understand ourselves, in order to practice empathy and better understand the actions of others. In today’s tense socio-political atmosphere, it is key to cultivate empathy while remaining aware of our own bias and staying open to the notion that our own narratives and conditions may not be universal – and thus, just like us, those who disagree with us also base their differing views on their experiences and backgrounds. It is this gap in understanding that creates a sense of threat when we disagree, and we have the opportunity to take responsibility for our own awareness.",
    "themepara3":"Societal pressure also directly correlates to our mental wellbeing. What roles do our constructive and destructive behaviors play in our mental health? What about the other way around? What do we learn about e.g. addiction from this point of view?",
    "themepara4":"The goal is to first expand our awareness on what drives our own behavior, and in doing so, awaken our independent, critical thinking skills. Are we making the decisions we really want to, or are we repeating a script ‘programmed’ in us by our surroundings? From there, the highest pursuit of the theme is to begin to view others with this same openness and curiosity.",

    "para2":"This is LungA’s way to contribute to the awareness of social responsibility on individual and collective level, in hope to effect and inspire those involved to take action and be more open towards the diversity of others in general.",
    "tba":"LungA LAB will take a year off. See you there in 2022",
